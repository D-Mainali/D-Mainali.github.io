                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to a student-made recommendation based guide built to help anyone of any coding background to gain a 
                    solid grasp of the foundation of Web Development as well as give direction toward how to advance your soon to be 
                    newly learned skills. I will have brief explanations of my own as well as my personal experiences, however, the bulk of
                    material that will be presented will primarily be from other resources such as well made youtube tutorials which I myself
                    studied from in order to create the website you are viewing right at this moment.
                </p>

                <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2><br>

                <p>
                    This is the first part of the guide, which will cover the core principle behind the structure of WebDev, HTML.
                    The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is not necesssarily a Coding Language as I myself previously assumed when 
                    previously gaining interest in learning WebDev, rather it is a Tag-based language in which tags are elements
                    that serve as building blocks that make up the structure a website, similar to how concrete, wood, metal and other
                    materials would make up a constructed building. We will be using Visual Studio Code for this entire process so unless
                    you have some other preference you may want to download VS code to follow along.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step I recommend you take toward learning HTML is watching this tutorial linked below, it's made by 
                    freeCodeCamp.org which walks through the simple steps to make a incredibly simple website, only using structure, 
                    devoid of style and otherfunctionalities. For each of the videos in this entire guide I will link my own personal 
                    handwritten notes to help you follow along and be able to refer back to if needed. This will also save you some time 
                    since you can practice coding without having to worry about forgetting a detail or two later on.
                    Some common material covered by the earlier videos may not be included in the later notes.
                </p>

                    The next stepping stone for WebDev would have to be an older playlist of the Net Ninja on youtube, one that serves as a 
                    beginner's introduction to HTML. To be clear, most of the material will have been covered by the first video, however, 
                    for the most part it will be beneficial to go through the entire playlist as the videos are not lengthy and may clear up 
                    any confusion and reinforce the content previously explained. The main reason to view this playlist is that it goes a
                    step further in explaining div tags, which was not mentioned before, as well as the inexplicably important concepts of 
                    ID's and Classes and miscellanious information that is worth reviewing. As usual, my notes are linked as well, but these 
                    will only cover new content that isn't mentioned by the previous video.
