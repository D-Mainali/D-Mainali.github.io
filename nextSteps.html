                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to a student-made recommendation based guide built to help anyone of any coding background to gain a 
                    solid grasp of the foundation of Web Development as well as give direction toward how to advance your soon to be 
                    newly learned skills. I will have brief explanations of my own as well as my personal experiences, however, the bulk of
                    material that will be presented will primarily be from other resources such as well made youtube tutorials which I myself
                    studied from in order to create the website you are viewing right at this moment.
                </p>

                <h2>What To Do Next</h2>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Now that you have aquired a thorough understanding of Web Development here are a few things you can do to move toward 
                    learning even more and building up from the foundation this guide has given you. This section is devoted to presenting
                    helpful resources, some of which you may or may not have seen from the videos themselves as well as possible avenues that
                    one can take on their way forward in this WebDev Journey. I will list these sources below as well as a short description
                    for each!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will also mention that I am in no way affiliated with any of the content creators and other sites linked below, all
                    images are simply used for a purpose of teaching by linking Thank you for finding this guide of use and make sure to 
                    check out my Creator page!
                </p>
                
                <section class = "media resource">
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg" target="_blank">
                        <img src="/img/Net Ninja Profile.jpeg" alt="">
                    </a>
                </section>

                <p>
                    The first resource I would HIGHLY recommend and many of you may agree since he was an integral aspect in the
                    construction of this guide and that is the Net Ninja's Youtube channel. As you were finishing up his HTML & CSS Crash
                    Course video, you may have seen all the kinds of tuturials he has available on his channel, CSS Animation, CSS Flexbox,
                    CSS Grid, Styling HTML5 Forms and Modern Javascript. The possibilities are abundant with this Ninja, not to mention
                    his developed coding abilities and structured style of teaching!
                </p>

                <section class = "media resource">
                    <iframe width="560" height="215" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwWHL3RyQgk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </section>

                <p>
                    The second resource I would recommend is this specific video from SkillThrive which essentially shows you how to make
                    a navbar similar to the one at the top of this page. It is slightly different since they use a logo instead of a title 
                    but I'd argue that's even more useful if you the viewer want to use your new skills to create a personal brand. Other 
                    than that I'd definitely check out their channel for other useful content as well!
                </p>

                <section class = "media resource">
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="/img/W3Schools Logo.png" alt="">
                    </a>
                </section>

                <p>
                    Next up is actually an incredible resource for Web Developlment and learning other coding languages, w3schools provides 
                    its users with numerous options of tuturials to learn and master, from topics in Programming to Data Analytics! One may
                    also recall that the Net Ninja also mentioned how awesome of a resource this in one of his videos within his HTML & CSS 
                    Crash Course tutorial. The site chooses to teach every concept in a well sectioned out series of tabs covering sub-topics
                    as well as less significant bits and pieces. I would highly recommend for one to visit the site and find out for
                    themselves how great of a tool it actually is!

                </p>

                <section class = "media resource">
                    <iframe width="560" height="215" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/er1JEDuPbZQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </section>

                <p>
                    And lastly, this one is a pretty interesting watch, a youtube video by DesignCourse, whose channel I'd most definetely 
                    look more into, that covers the BEM Methodology of CSS. BEM is essentially a version of CSS which is extremely important
                    to at least consider using when creating medium to large size projects. BEM CSS follows Block-Element-Modifier form, 
                    which happens to be useful in preventing situations where you may alter your CSS and it may affect more areas than what 
                    one intended! You will also for the first time hear about SCSS, an extention of the syntax of CSS, and SASS, a preprocessor 
                    scripting language with syntax advancements. I would suggest that one should do research on their own about these
                    concepts as well as the BEM Method to better understand them and implement them.
