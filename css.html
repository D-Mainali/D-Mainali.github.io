                    Hello, and welcome to a student-made recommendation based guide built to help anyone of any coding background to gain a 
                    solid grasp of the foundation of Web Development as well as give direction toward how to advance your soon to be 
                    newly learned skills. I will have brief explanations of my own as well as my personal experiences, however, the bulk of
                    material that will be presented will primarily be from other resources such as well made youtube tutorials which I myself
                    studied from in order to create the website you are viewing right at this moment.
                </p>

                <h2>Cascading Style Sheet</h2>
                <br>

                <p>
                    This is the second part of the guide, which will cover the most essential tool for styling in WebDev, CSS. Cascading
                    Style Sheets (CSS) are used to give decoration to the structure of WebDev that was laid out via HTML. CSS can be linked up to
                    an HTML file and style elements that make up the webpage. You can think of CSS as the paint, furniture and interior
                    design that decorates a building.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best introduction to CSS I would recommend is Jake Wright's 12 minute CSS tuturial, a fantastically made and well
                    structured insight into how one should think about creating a website and how to style it. Jake reverts to using old
                    fashion pen and paper to lay down what he wants out of the webpage and then dives into the coding aspect to display
                    exactly how he would make what he planned out. This incredibly thoughtful video is linked below coupled with my 
                    personal notes.

                <p>
                    The final and in my opinion most integral resource in this entire guide is the NetNinja's modernized HTML and 
                    CSS Crash Course. Now despite having already gone through learning HTML from the first part, I decided this to be the
                    final piece as it will go over the much more recent features offered by the newly updated HTML5. Not only that, however,
                    in this playlist of detailed and thorough content, you will witness the construction of a full fledged complex website
                    from laying out the bare structure to the styling of the site to ensure it's compatibility on multiple sized devices! 
                    Linked below will be the longest watch with the most lengthy amount of notes, but it will be well worth it as it will 
                    build up from the foundations you have set up and will sharpen your skills to a point in Web Development.

                    Congrats! With this final step you now have a solid understanding of the basics of how to make a website and you can 
                    now also design a website like the one made for this guide. "What's next?" you may ask, well the third part of this 
                    guide is meant to give some suggestions on how you can further widen your range of skills and depicts numerous resources 
                    and other tutorials that may prove helpful to use and point in a direction of interest for you.
